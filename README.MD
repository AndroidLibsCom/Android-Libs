Android-Libs is a portal with hundreds of android libraries and tools for developers.


Because of my passwords stored in `/app/config/database.php` I had to remove it from the repository.

Get a fresh one from [here.](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/app/config/database.php)

Do a `composer install` in the root directory.

I have used several packages. Please install them and follow their installation instructions:
* [Laravel IDE Helper Generator] (https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper)
* [Laravel 4 Debugbar] (https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar)
* [Cartalyst Sentry] (https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry)
* [Laravel GitHub] (https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-GitHub)
* [Eloquent Sluggable] (https://github.com/cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable)
* [Laravel Sitemap](https://github.com/RoumenDamianoff/laravel-sitemap)
* [Laravel RSS](https://github.com/thujohn/rss-l4)
* [Laravel Assets](https://github.com/Stolz/Assets)
* [OAuth for Laravel](https://github.com/artdarek/oauth-4-laravel)
* The initial library list used contents of the [Android Arsenal] (http://android-arsenal.com) Thanks for that!


After the `composer install` do a `php artisan migrate --package=cartalyst/sentry` for the Sentry2 package and a `php artisan migrate` for the Android-Libs tables.
